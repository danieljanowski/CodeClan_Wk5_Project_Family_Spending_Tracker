### Family Spending and Pocket Money Tracker

Build an app that allows users to track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

#### Possible Extensions

* The app should allow to create users
* The app should display user current budget/money left
* The app should allow to add money to users accounts with merchant/reason (merchant, pocket money, reward) and category (refund, earning)
* The user should be able to supply a balance warning levels, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they have gone over it.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
