# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

:star: Remember to gather PDA evidence :star:

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Web Programming (Sinatra, REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Constraints

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem
* Project must at minimum include the following core functionality:
  - Creating rows
  - Reading data
  - Deleting data
  - Updating data

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits.

## Brief

You are strongly encouraged to come up with your own idea for an app. This could be related to something you're interested in or an idea that you'd like to try out.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor before going ahead to ensure suitability. You'll then be required to write your own brief including an MVP and extensions.

If you're stuck for an idea, we have a selection of briefs to choose from.

On Friday, you'll have a planning session in small groups. This will give you practice in explaining an idea to others and articulating how you plan to execute it. You can also share ideas and get feedback on your plan.

## Group Planning

Why? You are gaining practice in communicating an idea, collaborating on the design process and making tradeoffs

4 groups of 5

Guidelines of the planning session:
- Get a whiteboard & pen
- Take it in turns to present your idea to the rest of the group (limit it to a reasonable 20 mins each so it doesn’t go on all day) and any data architecture decisions you’ve already made.
- Brainstorm the design of your project as a group (db structure, models, wireframes)
- Remember your idea won’t be fully formed yet so part of your planning will change in the future


## Our Briefs

- [Gym App](bank/Gym.md)
- [Shop Inventory](bank/Shop_Inventory.md)
- [Spending Tracker](bank/Spending_Tracker.md)
- [Sports Scoring](bank/Sports_Scoring.md)
- [Travel Bucket List](bank/Travel_Bucket_List.md)
- [Vet Management](bank/Vet_Management.md)


## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

On **Monday** we'll arrange one-to-ones with everyone to unblock any problems.

On **Wednesday** there will be an optional chance to do some presentation-prep with instructors and practice some of your presentation skills.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Thursday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

## Attendance

The cohort will meet at the usual time every morning. Your attendance is recorded every day as normal.

## PDA Reminder:

As part of this project you are required to take screenshots of the following:

```
- A Use Case Diagram  
- A Class diagram  
- An Object diagram  
- An Activity Diagram
- A user sitemap
- Two wireframe designs
- An example of pseudocode for a function
- One of your projects where you have worked alone and attach the Github link
```

Show user input being processed according to design requirements. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user inputting something into your program
- The user input being saved or used in some way
```

Show an interaction with data persistence. Take a screenshot of:

```
- Data being inputted into your program
- Confirmation of the data being saved
```

Show the correct output of results and feedback to user. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user requesting information or an action to be performed
- The user request being processed correctly and demonstrated in the program
```

Produce an Implementations Constraints plan detailing the following factors:

```
 - Hardware and software platforms
 - Performance requirements
 - Persistent storage and transactions
 - Usability
 - Budgets
 - Time   
```

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to Canvas
